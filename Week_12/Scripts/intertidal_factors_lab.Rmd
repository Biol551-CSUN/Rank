```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,

## Load Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(forcats)
```

## Load Data

```{r}
intertidal <- read_csv(here("Week_12", "Data", "intertidaldata.csv"))
```

## Clean Data

  A few typos in the quadrat labels would hinder our plotting. We can deal with these in fct_recode.
```{r}
intertidal_clean <- intertidal %>% 
mutate(Quadrat = fct_recode(Quadrat, "Mid" = "Mid  1", "Low" = 	
"Low  ."))

view(intertidal_clean)
```

## Plotting with Reorder

  We can reorganize the plotting of the low, mid, and high quadrats. We can relabel "Quadrat" here because we are really just looking at observations at a tidal level, and clarify the measurement used for "Algae."
  
```{r, Intertidal Algae Distribution}
ggplot(intertidal_clean, aes(x= fct_reorder(Quadrat, Algae, .desc = TRUE), y = Algae))+
  facet_wrap(~ Site)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x="Tidal Level", #"Quadrat" was a weird way to call this column
       y="Algae Cover (%)", #specifying the measurement method
       title="Algae Cover in Intertidal Observations",
       subtitle="by Locale")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "gray11"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "gray10"))
```
